## Exercise

in `records.test.csv` are a set of records. `index.js` has the core function to be implemented. Parse the records, use `SIZE_MAPPINGS` to convert each character to a weight, sum them up per row to get the total weight of the row. Then group rows sequentially by how many can fit within the `maxSize`. check `index.test.js` for expected output
